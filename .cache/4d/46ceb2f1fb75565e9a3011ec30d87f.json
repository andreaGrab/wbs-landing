We sell high-class furniture and design our limited collections with specialized designers and craftsmen with more than 25 years of experience.

So he decided on 29th august 1945 to open the La carpenteria di Lamberto at the age of 22.</p>\n                <p>He starts in small by doing chairs and photo frames for people and soon it was commissioned by the city to create many objects from benches for parks to furniture for official buildings. After two weeks he was known like Lamberto and every time when someone enters in his “house” was welcome and Mr. Lambert spends long times on chats, jokes and having a good time with his clients. And the fact is that in his carpentry there are no clients but only good people and friends. He was so passionate about his job and showing people how he and his team was working that has communicated transparency and creates a more trustworthy relationship with people.</p>\n                \n            <p>After 5 years of working hard, the company starts to grow. More and more projects were commissioned and more people joined the company. In 1995 the company became a big corporate with showrooms all over the country and global partners. Also, the name was changed to Lambert Designs S.p.a.</p>\n                \n            <p>On 27 October 1998, there was an accident in the headquarter building of the company where a gas explosion blew up the building at 00:17. Usually, there is no person inside the building at that time but Mr. Lambert was always at work behind his papers and unfortunately, he was there when the building fell down. He died at the age of 75.\n                After the accident, the company passed through a bad time.</p>\n            <p>All the furniture was lost and all the prototypes from the development labs for the next year’s collections were disrupted.\n            The company had lost a lot from 1998 to 2000 but the bigger loss was our boss and dear friend Lambert Hansen.\n            In 2002 we made a fusion with Algo&Sal GmbH and relaunched the company with a new name Workbench Studio S.p.a.</p>\n            <div class=\"mt-5 pb-5\">\n                <h1 class=\"mb-5 title\">What we are now</h1>\n                <p>Today we are a big corporate that offers premium build quality and unique design experiences. We like Mr. Lambert are driven by the passion and commitment to our work and our clients with clarity, transparency, and welcoming our clients in our showrooms.</p>\n                <p>After years of ups and downs, we are still here because we are driven by the exact same passion and strength that our boss had to open and lead the company for 53 years, with belief in what he was doing and love for people that were doing.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <footer class=\"text-center py-4\">\n        <p>© Copyright 2021 Workbench Studio S.p.a.
